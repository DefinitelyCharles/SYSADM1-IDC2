**Course Reflection**

||
| :- |
What were your initial expectations for the course? Did the course meet, exceed, or fall short of these expectations?
I was expecting it to be difficult, because its been 1 year since the last time i did anything related with setting up, like installing an operating system and configuring it after. Just as expected, it was difficult due to my inexperience.

||
| :- |
What were the main topics or concepts covered in the course? How did these topics contribute to your understanding of the subject matter?
The need to learn the basics, it is important for us to learn the basics. You cant go to advanced concepts without going through basic concepts, hence it is more important to master the basics.

||
| :- |
Reflecting on your learning process, what were the most effective strategies or techniques that helped you grasp and retain the course material?
The efficient way for me to learn in this subject is to search. Searching online on how to do the tasks made me more understanding of how it should be done.

||
| :- |
Were there any particular assignments, projects, or activities that significantly enhanced your learning experience? Why were they effective?
The activities in prelims helped me enhanced my learning, considering that I haven't done any installing of operating system for 1 year, I had to go back to basics.

||
| :- |
Did you encounter any challenges or difficulties during the course? How did you overcome these obstacles, and what did you learn from them?
Not having enough practice, I realized that if I want to do more progress I need to clear up my PC, download a virtual machine, download operating system installers and open up multiple (most case two) virtual computers. Basically, my PC can't handle all of that, because I remembered trying in my 1st year and my PC was struggling to boot up 2 virtual computers.

||
| :- |
Did the course encourage critical thinking and analysis? How did it promote higher-order thinking skills, such as problem-solving or decision-making?
It does encourage me to do better, most of the time I would be stuck at "what's the next step" part, thats when I try to solve it on my own with the assistance of internet.

||
| :- |
Reflecting on your personal growth, what new knowledge, skills, or perspectives did you gain from this course?
I realized that there is so much to learn than just installing operating systems, there was also subject like server administration and now system administration. They do cross each other's concepts sometimes but they are completely different.

||
| :- |
How do you plan to apply what you have learned in this course to your future studies, career, or personal life?
In my personal life, I can now do so much with my own personal computer. About future studies and career I can help others on their computers.
